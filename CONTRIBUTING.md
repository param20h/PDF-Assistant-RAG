# Contributing to PDF-Assistant-RAG 🤝

Welcome! This project is open for contributions under **GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSOC)**.  
Read this guide fully before opening a PR — it keeps things smooth for everyone.

## 📌 Important Branch Rules

| Branch | Purpose | Who pushes? |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `main` | Production (deployed to HuggingFace Spaces) | **Admin only** |
| `dev` | Integration — all contributor PRs target here | Contributors via PRs |
| `feature/*` | New features | Contributors |
| `fix/*` | Bug fixes | Contributors |
| `docs/*` | Documentation only | Contributors |

> ⚠️ **Never open a PR targeting `main`.** It will be closed automatically.  
> ⚠️ **Never modify `deploy.yml`, `render.yaml`, or HuggingFace config.**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/PDF-Assistant-RAG.git
cd PDF-Assistant-RAG
```

### 2. Add upstream remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/param20h/PDF-Assistant-RAG.git
```

### 3. Always branch from `dev`

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b feature/my-cool-feature upstream/dev
```

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

### Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy env template
cp ../.env.example .env            # Fill in your own dev values

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                         # Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

Make sure the backend is running first — the frontend proxies API requests to `localhost:8000`.

## 📬 Opening a Pull Request

1. **Pick an issue** — comment "I'd like to work on this" before starting
2. **Create your branch** from `dev` (see above)
3. **Make your changes** — keep commits focused and well-named
4. **Push and open a PR targeting `dev`**
5. **Fill in the PR template** completely
6. **Wait for CI to pass** — the `CI — Dev Branch` workflow must be green
7. **Address review feedback** — the admin (@param20h) is auto-assigned as reviewer

### Commit Message Format

```
type: short description (max 72 chars)

Optional longer explanation if needed.
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
```
feat: add PDF page count to document card
fix: scroll to bottom on new message
docs: add local setup instructions to README
```

## ✅ CI Checks

Every PR to `dev` automatically runs:

| Check | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| 🐍 **Backend Lint** | `flake8` on `backend/app/` (errors only) |
| ⚛️ **Frontend Type Check** | `tsc --noEmit` |
| ⚛️ **ESLint** | `npm run lint` |
| ⚛️ **Next.js Build** | Full production build to catch runtime errors |
| 📏 **PR Size Gate** | Warns if PR is unusually large |

All checks must be green before your PR can be merged.

## 🚫 What NOT to do

- Don't push directly to `main` or `dev` — always use PRs
- Don't commit `.env` files or API keys/secrets
- Don't add large binary files without discussing first
- Don't change CI/deployment workflows without admin approval
- Don't open multiple PRs for the same issue

---

## 🏷️ Issue Labels

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `good first issue` | Great for beginners |
| `bug` | Something is broken |
| `enhancement` | New feature request |
| `needs-triage` | Needs admin review |
| `help wanted` | Open for contributors |
| `wip` | Work in progress |

## 💬 Need Help?

Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/param20h/PDF-Assistant-RAG/discussions) before opening an issue if you're unsure. Mentors and the admin check discussions regularly.
